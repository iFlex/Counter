# Counter
An Android application that tries to recognise a model sound in the live stream from the microphone.
Say you want to count how many times you snap your fingers, this app would count that using sound.

This was my 3rd year team project built together with a 4 fellow students.

The Android version is located in the android folder. There is also desktop version in the desktop folder.
